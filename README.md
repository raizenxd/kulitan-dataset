# Kulitan Characters Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains a dataset of Kulitan characters, the traditional script of the Kapampangan language. The dataset is designed for training and evaluating machine learning models for character recognition using TensorFlow and Keras.

Kulitan is an ancient writing system with unique and intricate characters. This dataset supports efforts to preserve this cultural heritage by enabling modern technological applications.

## Features

- Images of individual Kulitan characters.
- Labeled with corresponding Unicode or phonetic representations.
- Suitable for tasks such as classification and character recognition.

## Applications

The dataset can be used for:

- Developing optical character recognition (OCR) systems for Kulitan.
- Training deep learning models for handwriting recognition.
- Promoting awareness and education about Kapampangan heritage.

## Dataset Structure

- **Images**: The dataset includes high-quality images of Kulitan characters.
- **Labels**: Each image is associated with its corresponding character label.
- **Format**: The dataset is organized into directories by character, suitable for use with machine learning frameworks.

## Usage

The dataset is compatible with TensorFlow and Keras. It can be easily integrated into training pipelines for image-based models. Users can preprocess and augment the data as needed to enhance model performance.

## Acknowledgments

This dataset was created to support the preservation and modernization of Kapampangan cultural heritage. Special thanks to the contributors who have digitized and organized this unique writing system.
